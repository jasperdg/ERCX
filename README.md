# ERCX
An ethereum protocol for the tokenization of assets. 

ERCX utalizes and combines the standards of ERC-721 and ERC-20 to facilitate the creation of blockchain based assets that are devisable over an x amount of ERC-20 tokens that are attached to a ERC-721 non-fungible token with a certain amount of meta-data.
